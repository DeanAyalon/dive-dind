# What Is This?
This repository was made to easily run [Docker Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) from within Docker-in-Docker.<br>

## Why? 
Docker Dive is no longer maintained, and currently fails inspecting images when running on an engine using the containrd image store.<br>
Although forks have fixed some issues - No image fixing the issue was introduced yet.<br>
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/issues/534)

Disabling the containerd image store does make Dive run properly, but disables the option to execute multi-platform builds

Instead - Enter Docker-in-Docker!<br>
The DinD container runs the regular docker image store, with Docker's contents managed within a volume

> **Note:** This image does not use the `:dind` variant of the docker image, so it might not, technically, be DinD, proper rename will come

# Use
## Script
The [`dive-dind`](./dive-dind) shell script is a wrapper around dive that starts the DinD automatically and offers automation for the following features:
- **Local images:** Save a local image, load it into DinD and Dive
  ```sh
  dive-dind local [image]
  ```
- **Clean:** Removes the DinD and volume, cleans up all stored images
  ```sh
  dive-dind clean
  ```

### Limits
The script disables the `build` command, as Dive uses a thin wrapper for legacy Docker builder.<br>
Instead, build your image locally using Buildx and use the `local` command to transfer it to the DinD for diving.

## Manual execution
```sh
docker compose up -d dive-dind
sleep 2
docker exec -it dive-dind docker compose run -it --rm dive [image]
```

Cleanup:
```sh
docker compose down -v
```

## Alternative
You can of course use dive within docker yourself without the image and script here, simply by running
```sh
docker run -dt --privileged --name dive-dind
sleep 2  # Docker needs time to start
docker exec -it dive-dind \
    docker run --rm -it \
    dive [image/command]
```
This repository just provides a convenient approach to managing it
